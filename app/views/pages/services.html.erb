    <p>Whether you are planning a wedding, birthday party or anything in between, we guarantee to have something for you!</p>
    <p>We prefer to work with each individual couple to get an idea of exactly what they are looking for, but we have general packages to explain some of our services. We are more than happy to take pieces of different packages and bring them together into the perfect planning environment for you!</p>
    <p>We like to start with a design and planning consultation to get an idea of your vision, personality, style, and most importantly, budget. After a consultation we are able to find out exactly which vendors will fit your needs, as well as what type of coordination will work the best. From the time of the first consultation to the last dance, you will be working with the same coordinators. No matter what question you have, or suggestion you would like to make, you will always be able to contact the same person you originally met with.</p>
    <p>After our consultation, we will contact you again, virtually or in person depending on location, and go over each aspect we have put together. This includes our vendor recommendations -if needed-, design board for your specific event, and details on your planning needs.</p>
    <p>On the big day, we will be the first to arrive and the very last to leave, no matter what planning package you request, this is always our promise. We will make sure everything runs smoothly and on time, from the flowers being delivered to the last table folded up. Each event will receive budget advice and assistance throughout the process, day-of coordination services, event timeline, and as many fun and exciting emails from us as you can handle.</p>
